# Epson PX-8 ROM Capsule Tools

Quick and dirty tools for manipulating Epson ROM Capsule binaries.

Mildly tested on Epson PX-8 ROM images. May also work for PX-4 and EHT-10.

* dumprom - extracts all of the files from a capsule ROM.
* makerom - combines files into a capsule ROM image.

There are limitations - see the comments at the top of each source file.
